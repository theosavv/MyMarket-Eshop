# Project Overview üîé
Prompted by the University class of Obeject Oriented Programming, we were assighned with creating an eshop, both the backend and the frontend. The project was implemented in cooperation.

# What we learned üí°
This project gave us the opportunity to apply the principles of Object Oriented Programming in practice and create a tool we see in our everyday lives (eshops), aquiring deep knowledge upon the structure of such projects, backend and frontend separation and many other technical aspects of the tools we used to  implement it.

# Technical info ‚öôÔ∏è
Using Java and object oriented programming principle, I was responsible for the Backend of the project while my collaborator implemeted the Frontend.
The Project includes not only separate packets including correspondingly the backend and the frontend, but also includes tests that insure efficiency and bug avoidance.
It is structured using a class database that enables saving the state of the program for future use, and other necessary classes some of which are the customer and the cart. 
Our e-shop includes many features like administrator product control tools,archieve of the orders made and statistics useful to administrators,necessary functionalities like adding and managing products, customer e-shop products overview, creating a cart and executing orders as well as other important features.
Note: openjdk-23 was used during implementation.
